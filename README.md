# homesick-vi-everywhere

A Homesick castle to use `vi` keybindings everywhere.

For example, this will allow you to use `vi` keybindings (instead of the default `emacs` keybindings) in:

* `bash`
* `irb` (Ruby)
* `mysql`
* `python`
* `sqlite3`
* `tmux`
* ...and possibly others that use GNU readline

## Installation

It's the same as any other Homesick castle (keep in mind that you can have more than one).  Here are the basics:

    gem install homesick
    homesick clone benjaminoakes/homesick-vi-everywhere
    homesick symlink benjaminoakes/homesick-vi-everywhere
