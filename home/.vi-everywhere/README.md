# vi-everywhere

Additional settings to enable `vi`-mode in more programs.  For more information, see the project [README](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/homesick-vi-everywhere).

## Technical notes

This is in a separate directory because `homesick` doesn't support merging directories well.  For more information, see:

* [Enable merging of directories - Issue #12 - technicalpickles/homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick/issues/12)
* [Overlay directory contents to allow muliple castles to write to the same directories by ethackal - Pull Request #20 - technicalpickles/homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick/pull/20)
